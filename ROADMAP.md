# Markout Development Roadmap

## Current Status: Alpha (v0.1.0)

Markout is currently in **alpha development**. The core reactive system is functional and many features are working, but the framework is not yet feature-complete and APIs may change.

## Feature Status Overview

- **Logic Values**: `:` prefixed attributes (`:count`, `:on-click`, `:class-`, `:style-`, `:watch-`)
- **Reactive Expressions**: `${...}` syntax for dynamic content in HTML and attributes
- **Looping**: `<template :foreach>` and `:foreach` attribute for array iteration
- **Components**: `<:define>` directive with slot support for reusable components
- **Fragments**: `<:import>` system for modular HTML organization
- **Server Infrastructure**: Complete Express.js server with middleware, rate limiting, compression
- **SSR/CSR**: Server-side rendering with seamless client-side hydration
- **Development Tools**: CLI with `markout serve`, hot reload, PM2 process management
- **Build System**: TypeScript compilation, client/server bundles via esbuild
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test suite (178+ tests) covering runtime, compiler, and integration

This roadmap is living document. Community feedback and contributions help shape priorities:

- **Feature Requests**: Open issues for missing functionality
- **Bug Reports**: Help identify stability and compatibility issues  
- **Documentation**: Improve examples, tutorials, and API docs
- **Testing**: Add test cases for edge cases and real-world scenarios
- **Performance**: Profile and optimize critical code paths

## Philosophy

Markout's development follows these principles:

- **Stability Over Speed**: Get it right before rushing to market
- **Developer Experience First**: Make common tasks simple and intuitive
- **HTML-Centric Design**: Build on web standards rather than replacing them
- **Thoughtful Evolution**: Changes driven by real needs, not trends
- **Community Feedback**: Listen to users but maintain coherent vision
