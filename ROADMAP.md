## Contributing

This roadmap is living document. Community feedback and contributions help shape priorities:

- **Feature Requests**: Open issues for missing functionality
- **Bug Reports**: Help identify stability and compatibility issues  
- **Documentation**: Improve examples, tutorials, and API docs
- **Testing**: Add test cases for edge cases and real-world scenarios
- **Performance**: Profile and optimize critical code paths

## Philosophy

Markout's development follows these principles:

- **Stability Over Speed**: Get it right before rushing to market
- **Developer Experience First**: Make common tasks simple and intuitive
- **HTML-Centric Design**: Build on web standards rather than replacing them
- **Thoughtful Evolution**: Changes driven by real needs, not trends
- **Community Feedback**: Listen to users but maintain coherent vision
