# Markout - HTML-First Reactive Web Framework

This is Markout, an alternative HTML-based reactive web framework for Node.js and the browser. Tagline: "Revolutionary: we thought it out before we pushed it out" ðŸ¤¯

## Core Philosophy

Markout is inspired by OpenLaszlo's elegant design principles and aims to be a "modern-day OpenLaszlo" - bringing back thoughtful, stable framework design. Key principles:

- **HTML-first approach**: Build on HTML rather than trying to replace it with JavaScript
- **Simplicity over complexity**: No ceremonies, boilerplate, or framework-specific rituals
- **Polymorphic execution**: Server-side pre-rendering with client-side hydration by design
- **Stability**: Thoughtful design from the start, not constant breaking changes
- **Developer experience**: Make the simple things simple while keeping complex things possible

## Markout Syntax

Three simple additions to standard HTML:

- **Directives**: `<:import>`, `<:define>` for modularity and components
- **Logic values**: `:` prefixed attributes (`:count`, `:on-click`) for reactive state
- **Reactive expressions**: `${...}` syntax for dynamic content

## Reserved Namespace and Naming Conventions

**Framework Reserved Identifiers**: Markout uses `$` as a reserved namespace to prevent conflicts with user code:

- **Runtime methods**: `$value()`, `$parent` - framework-provided scope access methods that users can access
- **Attribute prefixes**: `attr$`, `class$`, `style$`, `text$`, `event$` - internal runtime naming for reactive attributes
- **Declaration prohibition**: `$` is forbidden in user-declared identifiers (variables, functions, parameters) but users can access framework-provided `$` identifiers
- **Validation enforcement**: The validator prevents declaring new identifiers with `$` while allowing access to framework identifiers like `$parent` and `$value()`

**Safe Markup Generation**: Framework uses triple-dash comments for conflict-free code generation:

- **Triple-dash format**: `<!---...-->` instead of standard `<!--...-->` HTML comments
- **Automatic removal**: These comments are removed from source code during processing
- **Text markers**: Dynamic text insertion uses `<!---t{id}_{index}-->...<!---/-->` pattern
- **Conflict prevention**: User HTML comments remain untouched while framework markers are safely processed
- **Clean separation**: Framework can inject markup freely without fear of clashing with user content

### Advanced Import Features (for reference docs)

**Fragment Root Attribute Inheritance**: Sophisticated attribute override system:

- Fragment root tag attributes are added to `<:import>` parent tag unless already present
- Enables default/override pattern: fragment defines defaults, parent can override
- Parent scope overrides work through lexical scoping - component code remains unchanged
- Works recursively across nested imports and sub-imports
- Provides intuitive component customization without prop drilling
- Refined through multiple PoC iterations for natural developer experience

**Automatic Dependency Resolution for Component Libraries**: Critical for ecosystem adoption

- Each fragment can import its own dependencies (base styles, other components)
- Import deduplication ensures dependencies load only once per page
- Enables zero-ceremony component libraries - just point to `.htm` files
- Promotes actual code reuse within teams/organizations (private component libraries)
- Design systems become simple HTML fragments instead of complex build processes
- Same pattern works for third-party libraries (Bootstrap) and internal company libraries
- Removes traditional barriers to component sharing between projects

**Advanced Data Handling with `<:data>`**: Sophisticated reactive data system

- REST endpoint integration: `<:data :aka="users" :src="/api/users" />`
- Local reactive data: `<:data :aka="config" :json=${{...}} />`
- **Explicit Property Access**: Access data via logic value properties (e.g., `users.json.list`, `config.json.setting`) - no magic property promotion
- **Reliable Data State**: `json` property always defined (at most empty object), `:foreach` handles undefined/null gracefully
- Data pipelines: Chain `<:data>` directives where each is a function of previous ones
- Automatic reactivity: Data updates flow through dependent components naturally
- Localization example: Dynamic menu that updates when language changes
- No separate data layers: Declare data needs directly in HTML
- Composable transformations: Build complex data flows without Redux-style complexity
- Async boundary management: Synchronous reactivity triggered by events, timers, and async data operations
- Extensible transport layer: Custom communication via `:will-` and `:did-` delegate methods
- **Business Logic Architecture**: `<:data>` is where business logic should live (validation, processing, domain rules)
- **Separation of Concerns**: Presentation logic scattered in visual objects, business logic centralized in data objects
- **Example Pattern**: `<:data :aka="userService" :validate=${(user) => ...} />` for business rules, `:disabled=${!userService.validate(user)}` for presentation
- **Advanced Features TBD**: HTTP methods, authentication, caching, error handling, retries for production readiness
- Universal async interface: WebSockets, Workers, IndexedDB, WebRTC, Server-Sent Events
- Future tooling needs: Dependency analysis, circular detection, type inference for VS Code extension

**Reactive Expressions in Special Tags**:

- `<style>` and `<title>` tags support reactive expressions `${...}`
- `<script>` tags are excluded to avoid conflicts with user JavaScript template literals
- Enables reactive CSS and dynamic titles
- Special handling required - cannot use standard HTML comment placemarkers in these contexts
- **CSS Reactivity Guidelines**: Use sparingly for theming and configuration that changes infrequently (e.g., at application launch)
- For dynamic styling, prefer `:class-` and `:style-` logic values on individual elements (browser-optimized)
- **Reactive CSS Benefits**: Removes CSS preprocessing need, enables switchable themes, adaptive styling, eliminates CSS vs JS variable barrier, single source of truth for components
- **Use Cases**: Themes, dark mode, responsive breakpoints, component parameterization, CSS custom property values, coordinated styling logic
- Performance consideration: Updates entire `<style>` tag content; browsers not optimized for frequent CSS rule changes

**Runtime Components Architecture**: Current implementation focus

- **Evolution**: Moving from compile-time macro expansion to runtime component instantiation
- **Benefits**: Enables dynamic component type selection, shared component behavior, unified replication system
- **Foundation**: Server-side DOM `<template>` implementation with nested light-weight document and clone method
- **No Shadow DOM**: Clean debugging and styling while maintaining encapsulation through scoping system
- **Component Flow**: Parse `<:define>` â†’ Register template â†’ Clone on instantiation â†’ Activate reactive runtime
- **Replication Integration**: `<template :foreach>` uses same component instantiation system
- **Current Status**: Compiler generates BaseScopeProps structures that runtime instantiates as reactive scopes

**Current Implementation Status**: Fully functional server with SSR/CSR support

- **Server Infrastructure**: Complete Express.js server with middleware, rate limiting, compression, PM2 support
- **Reactive Runtime**: Full BaseContext/BaseScope/BaseValue system with DOM update batching
- **Compiler Pipeline**: Multi-phase compilation from HTML to reactive scope structures
- **Client-Server Hydration**: Server renders with reactive logic, client takes over seamlessly

    </button>
  </body>
</html>
```

## Technical Architecture

Built on TypeScript Node.js + Express.js foundation with complete full-stack reactive framework:

### **Reactive Runtime System**

- **Pull-based Reactive Engine**: Hierarchical scope system with proxy-based dependency tracking
- **Polymorphic DOM Support**: Same reactive logic works on browser DOM and server-side DOM for SSR/CSR
- **BaseContext**: Central coordinator with refresh cycles and batching system
- **BaseScope**: Hierarchical scopes with lexical variable lookup and proxy-based access
- **BaseValue**: Reactive values with expression evaluation, dependency tracking, and change propagation
- **WebScope**: Browser-specific scope implementation with DOM binding (attributes, classes, styles, text, events)

### **High-Performance DOM Update Batching**

- **Set-based Deduplication**: Automatically deduplicates multiple updates to same value using Set data structure
- **Automatic Batch Boundaries**: Batching integrated with reactive cycle boundaries - updates flushed when `refreshLevel` reaches 0
- **Transparent Operation**: Batching works seamlessly without requiring code changes
- **Cross-scope Batching**: Updates from multiple scopes batched in single context-wide pending Set
- **Propagation Integration**: Reactive propagation respects batching boundaries for optimal performance
- **Push and Pull Coverage**: Batches both `value.set()` updates and `context.refresh()`/`scope.updateValues()` calls
- **Nested Operation Support**: Handles nested refresh cycles while maintaining single batching context

### **Multi-Phase Compiler Pipeline**

Advanced compiler using Acorn for JavaScript AST analysis and escodegen for code generation:

- **Load Phase**: Parse HTML structure and extract scopes/values with location tracking
- **Validate Phase**: Enforce framework naming rules (no `$` in user identifiers) and syntax validation
- **Qualify Phase**: Auto-transform expressions with `this.` qualification for proper lexical scoping
- **Resolve Phase**: Build dependency graphs for reactive value updates and reference tracking
- **Comptime Phase**: Compile-time evaluation and optimization (future)
- **Treeshake Phase**: Remove unused values and optimize scope hierarchy
- **Generate Phase**: Output BaseScopeProps structure for runtime execution

### **HTML Processing Pipeline**

- **Sophisticated Parser**: Handles "augmented HTML" with `:` attributes and `${...}` expressions
- **Preprocessor**: Module loading, fragment imports, and dependency resolution
- **Server-side DOM**: Custom DOM implementation enabling server-side pre-rendering with reactive logic
